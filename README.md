# Mars-web-scraping-challenge
## Summary

This project was aimed at extracting and analyzing Mars news articles and weather data through web scraping methods.

## Overview

The primary objectives were to retrieve titles and preview text from Mars news articles and to scrape and analyze Mars weather data presented in an HTML table.

## Tools and Technologies

The project utilized Python along with Jupyter Notebook for coding and documentation. Beautiful Soup and Splinter were employed for web scraping tasks, while Pandas facilitated data manipulation.

## Project Structure:

### Part 1: Mars News Scraping

1. Utilized Splinter for automated browsing of the Mars news site.
2. Employed Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML content.
3. Extracted titles and preview text of news articles.
4. Stored results in a list of dictionaries.

### Part 2: Mars Weather Data Scraping and Analysis

1. Employed Splinter for automated browsing of the Mars Temperature Data Site.
2. Utilized Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the HTML table.
3. Assembled scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings.
4. Examined and converted data types as necessary.
5. Analyzed the dataset for insights into Martian months, days, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
6. Visualized results using bar charts and line plots.
7. Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Conclusion

The project showcased the effective use of web scraping techniques to gather and analyze data from Mars-related websites. The insights gained provide valuable information on various aspects of Mars such as months, days, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
